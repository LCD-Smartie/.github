Welcome to LCD Smartie!

LCD Smartie is an open-source software for Microsoft Windows which allows a character LCD to be used as an auxiliary display device for a PC. 
It was first released in 2002 and has since become a popular choice for hobbyists and enthusiasts who want to add a custom LCD display to their PC. 
The program was first created by BasieP in 2001 and 2004 became open source under source forge and the development continued for several years under this scheme.
LCD Smartie is now on GitHub! This is the mark of a new era for the program. 
We believe that this will help us to make the program even better in the future. We encourage everyone to contribute to the project and to help us make LCD Smartie the best character LCD software possible.
